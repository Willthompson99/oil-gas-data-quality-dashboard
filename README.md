# Oil & Gas Well Data Quality Dashboard

This project simulates a real-world oil and gas data quality monitoring system using SQLite and basic data profiling techniques. It is designed to align with roles focused on data quality, stewardship, and analytics within the energy sector.

## Project Overview
We use a mock dataset of well production data and apply SQL-based data quality rules to detect:
- Missing or null values
- Negative production volumes
- Date inconsistencies
- Duplicate Well IDs
- Outliers and summary stats

## Files Included
- `well_production.csv`: Simulated dataset
- `OilGasDataQuality.db`: SQLite database containing the `Well_Production` table
- `SQL_Data_Quality_Rules.sql`: SQL scripts for data profiling and quality checks

## Tools Used
- SQLite (via SQLite Studio or DB Browser)
- Python (for data generation)
- Power BI or Excel (for dashboard visualization)
- Google Docs/Notion (for metadata documentation)
- Draw.io or Lucidchart (for data flow diagram)

## Next Steps
- Visualize results using Power BI dashboards
- Document metadata and business terms
- Share and present findings to stakeholders
